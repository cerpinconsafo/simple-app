/* This is pretty good so far. I would like to play around with the overal look and feel of the contact card, depending on view or edit mode, as well as between mobile and web. 

I want this to be mobile facing first, so I will try to use my phone and Stacys iPhone to troubleshoot

Make the card feel more like a card and not a form/list. \

I dont have an idea for the organizing of the users list of contacts. 

I was thinking if there was a way to pull info form your contact app of your phone also. Worth looking into and trying.
